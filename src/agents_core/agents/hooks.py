Agent lifecycle hooks for logging and monitoring agent execution.

This module provides unified hooks for all agents to track their lifecycle events:
- Agent start: When an agent begins execution
- Agent end: When an agent completes execution with final output

These hooks can be applied to any agent to provide consistent logging across the system.
